INTRO TO HTML & CSS

REFLECTIONS

#HTML
What is HTML (acronym)
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages. 
HTML forms the foundation of website and web app development. It is the language that allows you to make 
sure your content is understandable to both people and computers. It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, 
videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences. It allows us to structure our content and bridge the gap between human and computer languages.

Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items

Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format

Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.

HTML is the skeleton,
CSS is the skin,
and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.
You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and 
exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable.

The focus is on semantic markup, which means labeling content for what it is, rather than just for formatting or convenience. This is important 
because it affects how differently abled individuals experience the web. By using semantic markup, you ensure that screen readers and search 
engines can accurately interpret and categorize the information on a page.
